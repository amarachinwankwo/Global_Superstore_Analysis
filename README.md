# Global Superstore Analysis

# OBJECTIVES

The aim of this analysis is to examine a Global Superstoreâ€™s data over a 4-year period, ranging from 2011 to 2014, across 147 countries. Through this analysis, I aimed to identify the array of products sold across primary categories such as Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology, including subcategories like chairs, smartphones, staples, binders, and more. This thorough examination serves as a foundation for making strategic decisions aimed at enhancing performance and maximizing profitability.
